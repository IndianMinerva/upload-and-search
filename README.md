#### Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

### How to run
execute `sh run.sh` and then the application could be accessed from the swagger-url (Unfortunately I don't support Windows yet :-) )


## N.B.
### Need to write a lot of test cases.
### Since I did not know the XML part, I did not do the XPATH AT ALL. However, I did include RepositoryPopulator in the config directory :-)
